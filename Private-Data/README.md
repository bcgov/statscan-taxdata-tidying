# Private Data 
Files in this directory are stored locally, and are not committed or sent to the central GitHub repository. A line in the .gitignore file keeps the files uncommitted/unstaged.

Even though these files are kept off the central repository, it still should not contain anything sensitive enough that it requires encryption when stored on your local drive (such as xlsx files). 

Please see the data-public/ README.md for more information on overall file structures and shares.
