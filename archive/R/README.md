# about the R folder
This folder contains all the R scripts used to wrangle the xlsx files into machine readable csv tables. Each script has a year reference for which the codes were used. The IND refers to individuals and FAM refers to family files.

Please note that the earlier FAM files can be converted using the same codes as in T1_Taxdata_Cleaning_FAM_2011.R. All that needs to be changed is the data input to include earlier years.
